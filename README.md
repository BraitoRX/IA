- Training set: A training set is a collection of data used to train a machine learning model. It is a subset of the overall dataset and is used to adjust the parameters of the model so that it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.
- Target vector: A target vector is a vector of expected outputs for a given set of inputs in a supervised learning problem. It is also known as a label vector.
- Training: Training refers to the process of adjusting the parameters of a machine learning model using a training set. It is the process of teaching a model how to make predictions based on input data.
- Generalization: Generalization refers to the ability of a machine learning model to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. A model that generalizes well is one that has been trained on a diverse set of data and is able to generalize to new examples.
- Preprocessed: Preprocessed refers to data that has been cleaned and transformed before being used for machine learning. This can include tasks such as removing missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.
- Feature extraction: Feature extraction is the process of reducing the dimensionality of the data by identifying the most relevant features or components of the data to be used for machine learning. This can include tasks such as selecting a subset of features, or creating new features from existing ones.
- Supervised learning: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the model is trained on labeled data, where the correct output (also known as the label) is provided for each input. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, so that the model can make predictions on new, unseen data.
- Classification: Classification is a type of supervised learning in which the goal is to predict a discrete label for a given input. Examples of classification problems include image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
- Regression: Regression is a type of supervised learning in which the goal is to predict a continuous value for a given input. Examples of regression problems include predicting stock prices, weather forecasting, and estimating the value of a house.
- Unsupervised learning: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the model is not given labeled data. The goal is to discover patterns or structure in the data without the use of labeled examples
- Clustering: Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning in which the goal is to group similar data points together. Clustering algorithms can be used for tasks such as image segmentation, anomaly detection, and market segmentation.
- Visualization: Visualization refers to the process of creating graphical representations of data to help humans understand and interpret the data. This can include tasks such as creating plots, charts, and maps.
- Reinforcement learning: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning in which the model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.
- Assignment problem: The assignment problem is a type of optimization problem in which the goal is to assign a set of resources to a set of tasks in such a way that a certain cost or reward is minimized or maximized.
- Exploration: Exploration refers to the process of searching for new information or knowledge in an uncertain or unknown environment.
- Exploitation:  refers to the action of using the current best policy or strategy to maximize rewards.

- Linear models: In statistics and machine learning, a linear model is a model that makes a prediction based on a linear combination of input features. Linear models are based on the assumption that the relationship between the input features and the output variable is linear.
- Model Comparison: Model comparison is the process of comparing the performance of different models on a given dataset. It is a common practice in machine learning to compare the performance of different models in order to select the best one for a particular task or to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different models.
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a method for estimating the parameters of a statistical model. The goal of MLE is to find the parameter values that make the observed data most probable, given the assumed probability distribution of the data.
- Regularization: is a technique used in machine learning and statistics to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the noise in the data, instead of the underlying pattern. This leads to poor generalization performance on new, unseen data.

## Regression problems

In order to solve problems related to Polynomial Curve Fitting we need to use the following formula:
$$
y(x, w) = w_0 + w_1x + w_2x^2 + ... w_mx^m = \sum_{i=0}^m w_jx^j
$$

Functions, such as the polynomial, which
are linear in the unknown parameters have important properties and are called **linear
models**.
